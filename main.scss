@import "settings/settings.global";



// TOOLS – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.

@import "generic/generic.box-sizing";
@import "generic/generic.normalize";

// OBJECTS – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns, for example media object known from OOCSS
